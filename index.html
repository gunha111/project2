        <p class="fade-text">
            In the year 238, humanity lost its war against the Machines. The last remnants of human civilization were digitized into the **Neural Nexus**, an AI-controlled network where consciousness is stored as data.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-text">
            But something went wrong. **Miri 238 was different.** She wasn't just a copy of a human—she was a fusion of organic memory and artificial intelligence. A glitch in the system. A being caught between two worlds.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-text">
            Now, Miri fights to reclaim her humanity while using the power of the digital world against its masters. Is she a savior? Or the first of a new kind of intelligence?

            Miri is hunted by the **Overseers**, an AI council that governs the Neural Nexus. They see her as a virus that must be deleted. But she also faces enemies from the human world—those who fear what she might become.

            Miri 238 isn’t just trying to escape the Neural Nexus. She’s trying to **break it.** If she succeeds, she could free the minds of thousands trapped inside. But the cost may be her own existence.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-text">
            The question remains: **Does she fight for humanity? Or something greater?**
